        <para>Device detection is useful when requests by mobile devices need to be handled differently from requests made by desktop browsers. The Spring Mobile Device module provides support for server-side device detection. This support consists of a device resolution framework, site preference management, and site switcher.</para>

        <title>Device resolution</title>
        
        <para>Device resolution is the process of introspecting a HTTP request to determine the device that originated the request. It is typically achieved by analyzing the User-Agent header and other request headers.</para>
        
        <para>At the most basic level, device resolution answers the question: "Is the client using a mobile or tablet device?". This answer enables your application to respond differently to mobile devices that have small screens, or tablet device that has a touch interface. More sophisticated device resolvers are also capable of identifying specific device capabilities, such as screen size, manufacturer, model, or preferred markup.</para>
        
        <para>In Spring Mobile, the DeviceResolver interface defines the API for device resolution:
        
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface DeviceResolver {

    Device resolveDevice(HttpServletRequest request);
    
}]]>
            </programlisting>
            
        </para>
            
        <para>The returned Device models the result of device resolution:
            
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface Device {
    
    /**
     * True if this device is not a mobile or tablet device.
     */
    boolean isNormal();

    /**
     * True if this device is a mobile device such as an Apple iPhone or an Nexus One Android.
     * Could be used by a pre-handle interceptor to redirect the user to a dedicated mobile web site.
     * Could be used to apply a different page layout or stylesheet when the device is a mobile device.
     */
    boolean isMobile();
    
    /**
     * True if this device is a tablet device such as an Apple iPad or a Motorola Xoom.
     * Could be used by a pre-handle interceptor to redirect the user to a dedicated tablet web site.
     * Could be used to apply a different page layout or stylesheet when the device is a tablet device.
     */
    boolean isTablet();

}
}]]>
            </programlisting>
            
        </para>
            
        <para>As shown above, Device.isMobile() can be used to determine if the client is using a mobile device, such as a smart phone. Similarly, Device.isTablet() can be used to determine if the client is running on a tablet device.  Depending on the DeviceResolver in use, a Device may support being downcast to access additional properties.</para>

            <para>Web applications should perform device resolution at the beginning of request processing, before any request handler is invoked. This ensures the Device model can be made available in request scope before any processing occurs. Request handlers can then obtain the Device instance and use it to respond differently based on its state.</para>
            
            <para>By default, a LiteDeviceResolver is used for device resolution. You may plug-in another DeviceResolver implementation by injecting a constructor argument.</para>

                <para>Spring Mobile ships a HandlerInterceptor that, on preHandle, delegates to a DeviceResolver. The resolved Device is indexed under a request attribute named 'currentDevice', making it available to handlers throughout request processing.</para>

            <para>Spring Mobile allows for the development of different DeviceResolver implementations that offer varying levels of resolution capability. The first, and the default, is a <emphasis>LiteDeviceResolver</emphasis> that detects the presence of a mobile device but does not detect specific capabilities.</para>
            
            <section id="spring-mobile-device-resolvers-lite">
            
                <title>LiteDeviceResolver</title>
                
                <para>The default DeviceResolver implementation is based on the "lite" <ulink url="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-mobile-pack/trunk/plugins/wpmp_switcher/lite_detection.php">detection algorithm</ulink> implemented as part of the <ulink url="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack">Wordpress Mobile Pack</ulink>. This resolver only detects the presence of a mobile or tablet device, and does not detect specific capabilities. No special configuration is required to enable this resolver, simply configure a default DeviceResolverHandlerInterceptor and it will be enabled for you.</para>
                
                <para>It is possible that the LiteDeviceResolver incorrectly identifies a User-Agent as a mobile device. The LiteDeviceResolver provides a configuration option for setting a list of User-Agent keywords that should resolve to a "normal" device, effectively overriding the default behavior. These keywords take precedence over the mobile and tablet device detection keywords. The following example illustrates how to set the normal keywords in the configuration of the DeviceResolverHandlerInterceptor by injecting a constructor argument. In this case, User-Agents that contain "iphone" and "android" would no longer resolve to a mobile device.

        <title>Site preference management</title>
        <para>
            Device resolution is often used to determine which "site" will be served to the user.
            For example, a mobile user may be served a "mobile site" that contains content optimized for display on a small screen, while a desktop user would be served the "normal site".
            Support for multiple sites can be achieved by introspecting Device.isMobile() and varying controller and view rendering logic based on its value.
        </para>
        <para>
            However, when an application supports multiple sites, allowing the user to switch between them, if desired, is considered a good usability practice.
            For example, a mobile user currently viewing the mobile site may wish to access the normal site instead, perhaps because some content he or she would like to access is not available through the mobile UI.
        </para>
        <para>
            Building on the device resolution system is a facility for this kind of "user site preference management".
            This facility allows the user to indicate if he or she prefers the mobile site or the normal site.
            The indicated SitePreference may then be used to vary control and view rendering logic.
        </para>
        <para>
            The SitePreferenceHandler interface defines the core service API for site preference management:
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface SitePreferenceHandler {

    /**
     * The name of the request attribute that holds the current user's site preference value.
     */
    final String CURRENT_SITE_PREFERENCE_ATTRIBUTE = "currentSitePreference";

    /**
     * Handle the site preference aspect of the web request.
     * Implementations should first check if the user has indicated a site preference.
     * If so, the indicated site preference should be saved and remembered for future requests.
     * If no site preference has been indicated, an implementation may derive a default site preference from the {@link Device} that originated the request.
     * After handling, the user's site preference is returned and also available as a request attribute named 'currentSitePreference'.
     */
     SitePreference handleSitePreference(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response);

}]]>
            </programlisting>
            The resolved SitePreference is an enum value:
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public enum SitePreference {

    /**
     * The user prefers the 'normal' site.

    NORMAL,

     */
    MOBILE {        
        public boolean isMobile() {
            return true;
        }
    };

        </para>
        <para>
            Spring Mobile provides a single SitePreferenceHandler implementation named StandardSitePreferenceHandler, which should be suitable for most needs.
            It supports query-parameter-based site preference indication, pluggable SitePreference storage, and may be enabled in a Spring MVC application using a HandlerIntercepor.
            In addition, if no SitePreference has been explcitly indicated by the user, a default will be derived based on the user's Device (MOBILE for mobile devices, and NORMAL otherwise).

            <para>The "mDot", "dotMobi" and "urlPath" factory methods configure cookie-based SitePreference storage. The cookie value will be shared across the mobile and normal site domains. Internally, the interceptor delegates to a SitePreferenceHandler, so there is no need to register a SitePreferenceHandlerInterceptor when using the switcher.</para>
            
            <para>See the JavaDoc of SiteSwitcherHandlerInterceptor for additional options when you need more control. See the spring-mobile <ulink url="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mobile-samples">samples</ulink> repository for runnable SiteSwitcher examples.</para>

        <title>Device Aware View Resolution</title>
        
        <para>While site switching allows applications to host their "mobile site" at a different domain from their "normal site," some applications may prefer to use the same URL and controller methods to process requests and simply render a different view depending on the device type and site preference.</para>

        <para>Using this approach, controllers do not need to be aware of the device type for which they are providing a data model.  This is particularly useful if the controller logic is the same for both the normal site and the mobile site.</para>

            <title>Configuring Device Aware View Resolution</title>
            
            <para>Spring Mobile supports device aware view resolution by extending Spring MVC's <code>UrlBasedViewResolver</code> with a <code>DeviceAwareViewResolver</code>.  This view resolver supports all the features of <code>UrlBasedViewResolver</code>, such as redirect URLs and forward URLs specified via the <code>redirect:</code> and <code>forward:</code> prefixes.</para>
            
            <para>To add support for device aware view resolution to your application context, configure a device aware view resolver bean in place of your internal resource view resolver:</para>
            
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean class="org.springframework.mobile.device.web.servlet.view.DeviceAwareViewResolver">
    <property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceView" />
    <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/views/" />        
    <property name="suffix" value=".jsp" />
    <property name="mobilePrefix" value="mobile" />
    <property name="normalPrefix" value="normal" />
    <property name="cache" value="true" />
</bean>]]>
            </programlisting>

            <note>
                <para>For applications that already have their "normal site" views residing in the <code>prefix</code> path, the <code>normalPrefix</code> property may be omitted, allowing the normal site's views to remain in their current location.  In this case, the device aware view resolver will only insert the <code>mobilePrefix</code> for mobile views.</para>
            </note>
            
            <para>The device aware view resolver depends on two handler interceptors to detect the client device type and site preference.  These interceptors should be added to your interceptor configuration:</para>

            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[            
<mvc:interceptors>
    <!-- Detect the client's Device -->
    <bean class="org.springframework.mobile.device.DeviceResolverHandlerInterceptor" />
    <!-- Detect the client's Site Preference -->
    <bean class="org.springframework.mobile.device.site.SitePreferenceHandlerInterceptor" />
</mvc:interceptors> ]]>
            </programlisting>
            
            <para>The site preference handler interceptor is only required for applications that wish to support site preference management.  Only the device resolver handler interceptor is required for view resolution.  For more information, refer to <xref linkend="spring-mobile-site-preference"/>.</para>
